Portfolio site — ready for GitHub Pages

Files:
- index.html
- styles.css
- avatar.png

Quick deploy (GitHub Pages) — no payment required:
1. Create a new GitHub repository (public). Example name: `portfolio`.
2. Upload all files from this ZIP to the repository root (or push from git).
3. In GitHub, go to Settings → Pages, and set the branch to `main` (or `master`) and folder `/ (root)`.
4. Save — GitHub will provide a URL like `https://yourusername.github.io/repository/` after a minute.

If you prefer, you can rename the repository to `<yourgithubusername>.github.io` and then the site will be available at `https://<yourgithubusername>.github.io/`.

You can replace avatar.png later with another image (keep the same filename) to update your photo.
